    + A router contains routes.
    + routes contain one or more route
    + rout has a path to direct to ("/" is for home) 
    and an element to show on that path (a component in examples below)
    so:
    <Route path="/" element={<MoviesGrid/>}></Route> 
    means: on home page, show MoviesGrid component.
    + Link tag to="" links user to the route path with the given component

    + both components need to know about movies and watchlist states so are passed them as props
    and also nedd access to the toggle function, so are passed that too
